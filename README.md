**Project Name:** `hello-world-docker`

**Description:**

A simple "Hello World" application built using Python, packaged into a Docker container.

This project demonstrates the basic steps of creating a Docker image from a Python script and running it as a container. The project consists of two main files:

1. `app.py`: A Python script that prints out "Hello, World!" to the console.
2. `Dockerfile`: A Dockerfile that defines the build process for the application, including copying the script into the container and setting up the environment.

The project can be built using the command `docker build -t hello-world-docker .`, and run using the command `docker run -it hello-world-docker`.

**Features:**

* Simple "Hello World" Python script
* Dockerfile defines build process for application
* Container runs Python script when launched

**Use Cases:**

* Demonstrate basic Docker concepts, such as building and running containers
* Showcase how to package a small Python application into a container
* Serve as a starting point for more complex projects that require multiple dependencies or services.
